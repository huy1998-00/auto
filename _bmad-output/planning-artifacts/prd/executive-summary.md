# Executive Summary

### Vision

The Mini-Game Website Automation & Pattern Tracking Tool enables users to automate game table interactions on a mini-game website through intelligent pattern-based decision making. The system observes game rounds, learns patterns from historical outcomes, and makes automated betting decisions based on user-defined pattern rules, maximizing efficiency and accuracy across multiple simultaneous game tables.

### Product Differentiator

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Multi-table parallel automation**: Run up to 6 game tables simultaneously, each with independent pattern matching and decision logic
- **Intelligent pattern recognition**: Learn from round history and make automated decisions based on user-defined pattern rules (e.g., "BBP-P" means if last 3 rounds were Blue-Blue-Blue, bet on Blue)
- **Real-time monitoring and control**: Desktop UI provides live status updates, pattern editing, and individual table controls
- **Resilient error handling**: Automatic recovery from page refreshes, network issues, and stuck states without data loss
- **Adaptive performance**: Dynamic screenshot frequency optimization based on game phase and system resources

**What Makes This Unique:**
Unlike simple automation scripts, this tool provides intelligent pattern-based decision making with multi-table parallel processing, comprehensive error recovery, and a user-friendly desktop interface for monitoring and control. The system learns from each round and adapts its behavior based on game state, making it a sophisticated automation solution rather than a basic clicker.
